When you install Groovy and add its @bin@ directory to your path, you can immediately start using several tools:

* @groovy@ - the command line interpreter for executing Groovy expressions or running Groovy scripts (\*.groovy files)
* @groovyc@ - the compiler, which compiles \*.groovy files to \*.class
* @groovysh@ - starts an interactive, command line shell in which you can execute Groovy statements
* @groovyConsole@ - starts a GUI console in which you can write complete scripts and execute them (includes syntax highlighting)
